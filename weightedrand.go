// Package weightedrand contains a performant data structure and algorithm used
// to randomly select an element from some kind of list, where the chances of
// each element to be selected not being equal, but defined by relative
// "weights" (or probabilities). This is called weighted random selection.
//
// Compare this package with (github.com/jmcvetta/randutil).WeightedChoice,
// which is optimized for the single operation case. In contrast, this package
// creates a presorted cache optimized for binary search, allowing for repeated
// selections from the same set to be significantly faster, especially for large
// data sets.
